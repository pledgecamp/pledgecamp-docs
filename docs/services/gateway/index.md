# Pledgecamp Blockchain Gateway

The Blockchain Gateway is a layer over the Blockchain (via web3.js) for interacting with Pledgecamp smart contracts. It provides API endpoints
that call smart contract functions and track contract data. It also tracks transaction statuses in order to allow the Oracle to easy
determine the state of any operation.
